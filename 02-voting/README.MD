# Simple On-Chain Voting DApp

## Objective

Use your foundational knowledge of Move programming, object ownership, and UI integration to create a simple decentralized voting application on the Sui blockchain.

## Project Requirements

1. Simple User Interface
   - Minimal UI displaying a voting proposal (e.g., "Which feature should we develop next?") with 2-3 selectable options.
   - Users can cast their votes by selecting an option and submitting their choice.
   - Questions can be mocked and predetermined. Use of imagination and make it funny
2. Wallet Integration
   - Provide a wallet connection to enable users to interact with their Sui wallets.
3. Move Module for Voting
   - Implement a Move module that records each user's vote on-chain, ensuring one vote per user per proposal.
   - Store the count of votes per option.
4. Results Page
   - Display live updated voting results fetched from the blockchain.
5. Submission
   - Submit your project as a public GitHub repository.
   - Include a concise README.md file with clear setup instructions.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Functional voting UI and real-time results.
- Correct wallet integration and NFT minting.
- Code readability and repository organization.
- All transactions should be on testnet and sponsored through Enoki
